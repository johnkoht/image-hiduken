image_hiduken.js
============

Image hiduken is a simple jQuery plugin for responsive images in dynamic websites and applications.


## Usage

Basic usage is simple. Just call image_hiduken on a selector:
```
$(selector).image_hiduken()
```

There are some custom attributes that you can pass to the plugin, including sizes for each of the various image thresholds:

```
$(selector).iamge_hiduken() {
  small_size : 300,
  medium_size : 640,
  large_size : 980,  
});
```

**WARNING**
This is brand new, haven't really tested it much. I'll have more updates over the next few weeks.
